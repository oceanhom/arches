"Instead, I just float in the void, watching him from seemingly every angle at once."

"Whatever it is, I rather enjoy it."
mon "\"So what is it that you want? Why have you forced me to intervene?\""

m "\"So, maybe if I do the opposite of what you want, this time I'll survive.\""
"I sense another burst of annoyance from the ethereal being."
mon "\"The issue, [mc], is that I myself do not know how the future might play out. I am only a messenger.\""

"Maybe a warning?"
mon "\"If I were to hazard a guess, it would be that great harm would come upon you if you were to proceed with the speech in Lupus.\""
"I feel like that's an obvious guess."
mon "\"Then why go against their advice?\""
"The Monitor seems to have temporarily given up on waiting for me to form words."
m "\"Well, to provoke this into happening, first of all.\""
mon "\"Well, you succeeded, as you can see.\""
m "\"Second of all, what about Alex? Why am I not allowed to warn him of what's happening?\""
mon "\"I do not know the answer to that, [mc], just that it is not in their plan.\""
"This time, I hear a growl under his words, and I'm a bit surprised by the amount of emotion I'm eliciting from this creature."
"It reminds me that maybe he's more on my side of the bridge rather than the parents'."
m "\"I thought the parents value life above all else?\""
mon "\"Well, not if that life is a threat to a greater quantity of life.\""
m "\"They took control of my voice. I should at least have the freedom to say what I want.\""
"The monitor closes his eyes in a way that tells me he's finally receiving direct communication."
mon "\"Then risk jeopardizing the millennia-long mission you are integral to.\""
"His voice is cold and flat."
"Finally, I feel fully defeated."
"Powerless, like I've felt ever since Amicus kidnapped me from my bedroom in Rome."
"I am just a puppet, and if that's the case, it's hard to understand why I'm involved in any of this at all."
"The monitor opens his eyes and stares back at me, and I see what almost looks like sympathy."
mon "\"I know it may seem unfair, and it truly is, but the parents are making a great sacrifice in interfering as much as they are to guide you.\""
"That annoys me quite a bit, especially since it feels like I'm the one doing their dirty work."
m "\"Yeah, seems like they're giving up a lot.\""
mon "\"They are. They wish not to do such things to a sapient, but you were chosen for this, and if you listen to their advice, things will be much easier.\""
"I shake my imaginary head."
m "\"Yeah, fine, but I will warn Alex about what's going to happen to him. Give me your word that you're not going to allow him to be executed, and I'll do what they want.\""
mon "\"It is not my--\""

"Still, Amicus knows that he won't be scolding his brother after all is said and done."
"Cass had not been himself since his poisoning, and Amicus had suspected that what would be his first speech since that incident would not go well."
"Amicus also imagines that Cassius having to verbally pledge his support to him only made it more difficult for his younger brother."
"But now, the exhibition match is already upon him, and because of that uninspiring speech, Amicus realizes that he must lose this match if he's to quell the City of Rebellion's fury."

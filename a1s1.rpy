"Memories surface of that bright, blue-sky day, of Professor Urbicus laying on his back in the street next to me as I played dead."

"And then it failed."

"Suddenly, I've just laid bare my deepest fears to this jackal that I've met in person a total of maybe a few dozen times."
"I realize that I must be Adastra's worst spy, and the always suspicious part of my mind wonders if I'm being purposefully manipulated."
"But this feeling of comfort is so rare and welcome that I don't care for the moment."
"I've always admired Khemian culture, but for the first time I feel as if I'm being included in it, and it's wonderful."

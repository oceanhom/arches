"Despite having seen this monster in some form or another for over fifteen years now, Cameron realizes he never really tried to move towards it."
"In the beginning, he'd try to run away, of course, but it ended up following him."
"It never moved when he was looking at it, but the second he looked away and back again, it would reappear closer, usually at that twenty to thirty foot distance."
"When he learned to ignore it, it just sort of blended into the background, and he almost stopped noticing it."
"As Cameron squeezes through the boards covering the window, he's only a few feet away from the thing."
"He realizes that if he makes contact with it, that if it's solid, then he won't know what to think."
"He never even considered that it might be real."
"But now, as those unnaturally long claws dangle from the sleeves of the raincoat, Cameron starts to worry."
"As he moves those last few feet, though, Raincoat Monster starts to dissolve into the dim lighting of the room, and the coyote is inside."

"Cameron moves toward it again, slowly this time, the creature still seemingly frozen, but in a way a real person would try to appear frozen."
"This creature is almost like an imitation of the one he's gotten to know so well, the one that almost became a companion of sorts in his childhood."
"About halfway across the dark, cluttered motel room, Raincoat Monster bends sideways, almost like it's going to do a cartwheel, toward the bathroom door."
"Its heavily-clawed hands don't move, though, and instead it just keeps bending like a bridge, like an arch."

"Raincoat Monster had toyed with him plenty of times before, especially the first time he saw it."
"It was his own mind doing it, after all."
"But what makes him feel nervous now, is that it seems like there's something else behind it."
"Almost like whatever was behind his first vision in that other motel room is behind this as well."
"So he should leave, right?"
"Whatever that is doesn't seem to have very good intentions."
"All it seems to want to do is fuck with him."

"Devon keeps trying to figure out how things could have gone so wrong."
"His feelings earlier about an impending catastrophic failure now feel fully validated."
"It's happened."
"He took those courses emphasizing engineering ethics."
"He studied cases in which every step of a disaster was detailed and exactly how each step was preventable."
"He took great care in his career to make sure he would never become one of those case studies, that the machines he helped design were as safe as possible."
"And while he'd already thought this, it's the fact he didn't even know Cameron was on an antipsychotic at some point, just that he was on \"meds\"."
"He knew Cameron's problems were concerning, and he reassured himself with a crash course in abnormal psychology."
"Psychology..."
"While he was never as openly disdainful as his peers, the idea of trying to explain complex behavior through endless theories was frustrating, to say the least."
"He chalked it up to him being one of those people who simply needed a solid answer, a number."
"But he also remembers those months when Cameron was on his medication, how one night he'd had Dev sit with him in the arts building on campus."
"It was late and no one was around as Cameron almost angrily bashed on the keys of the grand piano, asking him if any of it sounded good."
"Dev said it sounded fine."
"Then, the coyote finally broke down, saying he couldn't write music anymore."
"That emotionally, things had become black and white, that there was a wall between him and who he was."
"That the medicine he was taking was the reason why he fucked up his chance with the label."
"And as Cameron sobbed over the piano, Devon had decided that psychology doesn't know a thing about how people work."
"That psychiatrists might as well be drug dealers with an office."
"It had been the same for his mother, after what happened with Lupita."
"Even now, she struggles with her addiction to benzodiazepines, something carelessly prescribed to her so she'd stop wailing all the time."
"To Devon, it seemed like psychology never moved past lobotomies."
"Instead, they just converted it into pills."
"And he never really changed that mindset, and it's why he never encouraged Cameron to seek some sort of help, especially if he didn't want it."
"What he took away from his research is that hallucinations of any kind are of serious concern and should never be brushed off."
"But he had done just that with the idea that maybe there's more to hallucinations for some people than psychology will ever understand."
"Maybe it's ghosts."
"Devon wants to hit himself."
"In fact, he wishes the weasel man had added a kick in the nuts to go with the gut punch, something else to help remind him how utterly stupid he is."
"The concept of the paranormal is so far from his mind at this point that he doubts he'll ever dabble in it again."

"About a dozen days pass and I have finally finished getting everything ready for the Winter Solstice."
"A couple of restless nights and a few bottles of wine seemed to do the trick."
"Lyall keeping me company also helped, even if he spent most of his time out in the hall."
"I have to attend these boring meetings though."
"The only good thing to come out of them are my conversations with Raynar once the meetings are done."
"He's grown quite fond of me over the past few days."
"I don't know why he likes me so much."
"He treats Lord Kadaj and I the same professionally, but he treats me like a friend."
"Then there's Lyall."
"Lately I think he's been distancing himself from me."
"I assume it's because of that little revelation that occured."
"It's crossed my mind multiple times as well."
"I can't help but be thankful for this little bit of space that's been provided."
"True, I enjoy his company, but I feel that I needed some time to myself in order to assess my thoughts."
"And I have finally come to a conclusion."
"I think I'm in love with him?"
"Call it what you will, but it's the closest I have ever gotten to feeling like I am in love with someone."
"Childhood crushes and young love don't compare to this at all."
"It feels wrong considering I've only been here for a while, but every time I am around him my chest twists into knots and I feel all warm inside."
"Every day I wake up and he's the first thing on my mind."
"His personality, those big eyes, that beautiful dark coat of fur and bushy tail."

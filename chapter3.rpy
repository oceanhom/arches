"It's been almost a week since I've woken up."
"The weather gets colder and colder every day and I find myself yearning for a warm bath every morning when I wake up."
"The past couple of days have been pretty relaxing to say the least."
"I've had plenty of time to work on preparations for the Ball, and I've been taking it at a nice pace."
"Well, a pace that's nice for me at least."
"All I really have to do is make sure the resources are readily accessible and calculate the cost of everything."
"I mean, there's more to it than that, but that's the gist of it."
"I've been wandering around the castle with Lyall on my free time."
"Although I rarely allow myself free time, but every day I do take a break."
"He's been very good company the past couple days and he's been showing me around."
"We haven't gone into the city yet, but I've been able to explore most of the castle."
"Lyall has managed to cause my inner child to break out as we laugh and joke while walking through the halls."
"It's funny how he's supposed to be my guard, yet so far he's been my glorified guide."
"I do appreciate the assurance though, and having someone there to keep me company and show me around is really nice."
"It's a good thing that we get along. I'd hate for this whole thing to feel too professional."
"The other day he took me up to the tallest tower where you could see the entire City and Fjord."
"His fur was blowing in the wind and he had that dreamy look in his eyes."
"I've spoken to Raynar a couple times."
"I'm not too sure how I should feel about him."
"He's very kind, and seems to have his wits about him."
"There's still something very intimidating about him though."
"At the beginning of every interaction with him I start things out anxious, but then he manages to completely change the mood of the room."
"I guess he's just a big, friendly guy."
"I've ran into Adrius a few times during the week."
"He hasn't really paid me much mind aside from the occasional greeting and I honestly prefer it that way."
"But with the few interactions that we've had where it would have been extremely awkward if we didn't talk, it felt more like an interrogation."
"He's constantly asking me questions about Eryn."
"I have a feeling that he doesn't talk with people much."
"I also feel like the more I avoid him, the better."
"And then there's Leif."
"I haven't seen him much."
"I passed him in the hallway once and we had a chat that wasn't too interesting."
"He's probably busy with his own work."
"Which makes me feel like I've been too relaxed lately."
"I should probably crack down on my work as well."
